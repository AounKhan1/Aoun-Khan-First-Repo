    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Desi Chicken Sobat is a traditional Pashtun and Saraiki dish made with tender desi chicken curry served over soaked roti or naan. The dish is rich in flavors, combining slow-cooked chicken with aromatic spices, yogurt, and a deliciously soft bread base.</p>
    <p>This dish is commonly enjoyed in rural areas of Pakistan, particularly in Taunsa Sharif, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, and is served at family gatherings.</p>
